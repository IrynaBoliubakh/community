For Serverless PostgreSQL, Percona offers builds which are based on [Neon](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon)

This solution provides a serverless experience for PostgreSQL by separating the compute nodes and storage nodes. This allows scaling your storage as your data grows and makes the process transparent for end users.

## Branching data

Have you ever needed to fork your data set and work on it independently, similar to using Git branches? Now, you can do this with ease using Serverless PostgreSQL. Simply branch out your data, conduct necessary experiments, and have peace of mind knowing that your primary data set remains unaffected.
